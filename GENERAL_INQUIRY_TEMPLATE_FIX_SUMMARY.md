# General Inquiry Template Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The `general_inquiry.blade.php` email template had a corrupted HTML structure where the meta viewport tag was broken and mixed with content that should have been in the body of the email.

## Original Problem
```html
<meta name="viewport" content=        <p>Looking forward to hearing from you soon!</p>
        
        <p><strong>Best regards,</strong><br>

    </div>ice-width, initial-scale=1.0">
```

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed HTML Structure**: Corrected the broken meta viewport tag
